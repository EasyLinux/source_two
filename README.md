## Project naming requirements
SOURCE TWO is the name of the frame. If you are thinking about manufacturing it, you are expected to prefix the name with a brand name in order to allow customers to distinguish the different manufacturers, e.g. “TBS SOURCE TWO”. As a manufacturer you are also expected to denote the version number of the frame files that you have placed as basis of the project, e.g. “TBS SOURCE TWO V0.1”. 
If you have forked the project, you need to give it another name in order to avoid confusion between SOURCE TWO and your project.
Accessories from the SOURCE TWO project also need to be named with the entire prefix, e.g. “TBS SOURCE TWO FPV Camera Adapter”. Unless the file is not compatible with certain versions of the frame, the compatible version number or version range also needs to be included in the name, e.g. “TBS SOURCE TWO FPV Camera Adapter V0.1 - V2”
